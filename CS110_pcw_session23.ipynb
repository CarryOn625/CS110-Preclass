Then, the second string has possible subsequences of \"b\",\"c\", and \"bc\". Now, we compare all the subsequences and find that \"bc\" overlaps and is the longest overlapping subsequence (others being \"b\" and \"c\").\n",

When comparing very short strings, this might even be faster (not sure) but that is where the advantages end. It is extremely inefficient and as we saw, even with a string of length 3, the possible subsequences was 8. This would exponentially increase as the length of the string increases."
